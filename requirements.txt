# for unimarnet which conflict with others 
# we need  
# tokenizers-0.19.1 
# torch-2.3.1
# torchvision-0.18.1
# transformers-4.42.4

#texteller requires transformers==4.47 but conflicts with texifyextractor's transformers==4.42.4

#pix2tex which is used  in latexocr/py file, timm==0.5.4 and x-transformer = 0.15.0 
#donut requires timm==0.9.16 conflicting with pix2tex 

#texify(transformers==4.42.4) and nougat also transformers conflict, need to reinstall everytime to test

#surya ocr transformer conflicts with texteller 

# IMPORTANT: Due to dependency conflicts, we've split requirements into separate files:
# - requirements-ocr.txt: OCR models (EasyOCR, Tesseract, Surya)
# - requirements-paddle.txt: PaddleOCR and dependencies
# - requirements-table.txt: Table extraction models (Camelot, Tabula, etc.)
# - requirements-ppstructure.txt: PPStructure (PaddleOCR table extraction)
# - requirements-math.txt: Math expression models (UniMERNet, etc.)
#
# Install the specific group you need:
#   pip install -r requirements-ocr.txt
#   pip install -r requirements-paddle.txt
#   pip install -r requirements-table.txt
#   pip install -r requirements-ppstructure.txt
#   pip install -r requirements-math.txt
#
# Or install this base file for common functionality without conflicts
